## R1 - Application Details
Backloggo (name pending) is a full stack application with the purpose of helping end users find and document what games they may want to play. Gaming has grown to such a large scale that it’s impossible to play or even know every game out there. This app aims to help users by allowing them to search through a catalogue and discover games they may not know existed and add them into a “to play” list. When gamers grow up, the excitement to game is still there but, as life goes on, the time can be lacking. Having the ability to store a backlog of games in one place can really help gamers select the right game to play when they do find time to revisit their hobby.
Individual platforms such as Sony, Steam, Epic Games, Uplay, Gog, Xbox, Nintendo along with many other gaming stores/platforms have their own wish list features but the games often vanish from a list once a game is purchased. Storing all games in the one app to view a combined wish list and backlog will be a game changer to allow players to view all of their owned and wished for games in the one place.

The target audience of the app is gamers of all shapes and sizes. It may appeal slightly more to the gamers with less time though as organisation for these users could be more important. Users who grew up with gaming as a large part of their lives can’t always continue the trend into their adult lives. For these users, where gaming sessions could be few and far between, it would be very helpful to have this app so they can check their lists when they do find time.
Even for gamers with the time to play consistently, the sheer number of games that have flooded the market can be hard to keep up with. When their lists are spread out across multiple platforms and consoles, it can be very hard to keep up. Having a single list allows users to check what they want to play next while also providing a feel of achievement when games are added to a user’s completed list.
